\begin_layout Abstract
We describe an hybrid agent-based model coupling a cellular automata and
 a dynamic network, for the simulation of urban growth.
 Heterogeneous aspects of urban systems are taken into account in the sense
 that morphologic structure but also functional properties of the city are
 implied in the evolution.
 Classic measures of description and performances for generated configuration
 are used to classify and explore generated patterns, and we also propose
 an economic evaluation of the structure using sensitivity of segregation
 models to spatial configuration.
 We can apply the model to a real-world situation, proposing an optimisation
 of the repartition of activities in a zoning context.

), that proposed to integrate network effects in a CA model for modeling
 urban morphology.
 Their aim was to test the effects of physical proximity on urban shape,
 introducing the modeling of urban mobility through a network which evolution
 is coupled with the evolution of the urban shape.
 We generalise the model, allowing to take into account functional properties
 of the urban environment.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Sensitivity to initial conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the magnitude of repetitions useful to get meaningful values
 of output functions and to ensure some validity in the results, it is necessary
 to investigate the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions of the
 spatial configuration.
 Indeed, if the conclusions that can be drawn in a particular case are significa
ntly modified by small changes in the spatial configuration, one will differentl
y apply the model than in a case where abstract topology of activities has
 more influence: one will obviously elaborate totally different exploration
 heuristics to proceed to optimisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we launched large number of simulations with same parameter values
 but different initial configurations, in order to get statistical distributions
 of outputs at fixed parameters.
 Standard deviations were calculated for samples of the parameter space
 (around 20 samples) and the distributions were each time of same amplitude
 and same deviation.
 Fig.
 3 shows these distributions for the sample corresponding to equal weights
 to each parameter.
 Given the numerical values of deviations (each time around 0.1 times the
 amplitude of the function), we can conclude that outputs are significantly
 less sensitive to spatial positions than to topology of activities and
 parameters values (as the exploration of parameter space results show in
 the following).
 That justify the small number of repetition needed to have reasonnable
 values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Sensitivity to update type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generated structures seem to be quite sensible to the type of update
 that is done at each time step, i.
 e.
 to the number of cells that are built at each time step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Exploration of the parameter space

\begin_layout Standard
We explored a grid of the 4-dimensional space of the

 parameters, the relative weights of variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Concrete application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we have shown that outputs on which we want to optimise, such as accessibi
lity to activities or network performance, are significantly more sensible
 to initial configuration of activities than to spatial distribution, we
 can apply the model to the optimisation of activities repartition, given
 an existing spatial structure.
 That situation can occur in a planning problem, then one has to decide
 possible landuses of predefined zones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reproduction of existing urban facts (in the sense of the morphological
 structures) and the possible applications showed that the implemented model
 may be useful for evidence-based decision-making in urban planning.
 However, many aspects can be discussed as they raise crucial questions
 and would need further explorations.
