==Intro==
Cite recent papers ?
Reviews of possible applications.


==Description==
Be concise.
output described here ?

-> quid of the economical ABM ?

insert descriptive chart !

==Results==

- reproduce concentric/linear/etc cities (cit cours de Mangin ou bien Corbu)
-> observe that although structures may have been planned at local (or "global") scale, it is in great part "self organised"
Q of the scale of th emodel? of work at this scale, houses are not houses
But in application, more local scale !
Discuss on that

exploration: explain parameters that are not explored (proxies of real)
economic not plotted because efficiency -> however, directly linked to morphology and values (function, what properties, hypothese ?)


application: plot real, show optimal, show bad with no mixity.
explain values of fixed oarameters, should be logic
explain context of zoning

==Discussion==
Q of scale : cit Pumain scale-free, should be ok with results.
At the instar of Barthelemy, have selected domining processes.

discussion of validity? Reproduction of existing shapes ? ok but should need strong quantification
Morphological enveloppe needed for larger scale problems !



discussion on application: local scale, does it not neglect too much phenomena economics exchanges etc.
Cit urban economy as scale-free NW !
-> we miss essential phenomena but still we manage to reproduce core phenomena -> maybe ex attractivity to center is a proxy of activities. of course. so valib locally?
raises question of minimal dimension of representation of urban space (idea for phd)


Economic ABM Complex Coupling?

==cl==
rappel bonnes formes et application comme quoi modèle CA pas morts et essentiel decisions planning ?
vers evidence pour une ville mixte? (dpd results) cit Mangin ville farnchisée
cit Lefebvre par rapport à outils techniques, situation a telle évoluée ?
